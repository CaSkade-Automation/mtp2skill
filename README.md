# Mapping-MTP-to-OWL
This repository contains an automated mapping approach to transform a Module Type Package into a specific capability ontology. 
This ontology consists of several individual ontologies, also called Ontology Design Pattern (ODP).  
Each ODP is built upon an existing industry standard or norm. The mapping is formulated in the RML language. (https://rml.io/) 
This mapping language offers the possibility to use predefined expressions. 
Thus the mapping can be generated by TripleMaps. XPath is used to address the contents of the MTP. 

# Usage:
This section describes how the mapping tool can be used.
First a new project must be opened in a Java editor like Eclipse.
Within this project several input files are needed:

- The MTP
- The State Machine Template
- The Mapping Script

These files must be located in the path /src/main/resources/. 
The file name of the MTP must be adjusted in /src/main/java/XPathReplace.java in line 49.
The output of the mapping can be taken from the path /src/main/resources/Output/MappingOutput.ttl.

Within the mapping script, the file path of the MTP must also be adjusted for each TripleMap.
